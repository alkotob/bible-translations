When the person healed of leprosy was confirmed by the habr to be tahir from the leprosy, this would allow him to be re-admitted to the society. It would also be a proof to the ahbar that a person with leprosy had been healed. Al-Yahud believed that only al-masih could heal a Yahudi who had leprosy. Thus the ahbar should understand that Isa was al-masih.

When Isa used this title with the religious authorities, they understood this meaning.

But most people assumed that the half-brothers of Isa were full biological brothers. The idea that Yusif had children from a previous marriage is improbable for several reasons. 1) Isa is called the first-born son of Mariam, which implies she had others. 2) Yusif and Mariam went to Bethlehem for the birth of Isa and later fled to Egypt. No other children are mentioned in the whole story. So these brothers and sisters are almost certainly children born to Yusif and Mariam after Mariam gave birth to Isa.

It had three primary meanings in the Tawrat. 1) Sometimes, it meant a human being, as in Numbers 23:19. 2) Many times, it was used to mean a nabi or rasul (93 times in the scroll of Ezekiel alone). 3) The one prophesied in the Tawrah, Daniel 7:14, who was coming to Allah on the clouds of the sky and whom Allah was going to give rule, kingship, and glory over all peoples, nations, and language groups forever in an eternal kingdom. When Isa used this title with the religious authorities, they understood this meaning. See chapter 14:61-62.

In various other translations of the Injil that are based on later manuscripts, there is a story inserted here. This translation is from the oldest manuscript of the Injil in the world, (before 350 A.D.), which does not include the story. Thus this translation does not include it. The story is about what Isa told the hawariyun to do after he was resurrected from death to life.

Because of the census, this part was apparently already full with other relatives. Animals were usually brought inside at night and stayed in the lower part of the room. Their food was in feeding troughs, and Isa was put in one of these. (see verse 12)

Adam was formed from clay or dirt and Allah breathed into him the breath of life. (See the Tawrat, Genesis 2:7) All the other ancestors were conceived through sexual intercourse between a human father and mother. The Tawrat refers to the regent of Allah as his son, which of course is not literal. Adam was a regent for Allah (a person appointed by a king, in this case Allah, to act for him). In addition to Adam, Dawood is also referred to in the same way as regent in the Zabur, Psalms 2:7.

The first meaning is that Isa is saying that those people who follow Isa must love him more than they love their family, so that by comparison their love for their family is like hate. The second meaning of 'hate' is 'not choose'. This meaning is found in the Tawrat, Malachi 1:3. According to this meaning, those people who follow Isa must choose him over their family.

Al-Yahud had three steps to marriage: engagement, betrothal, and marriage. At betrothal, a couple was legally husband and wife, but they had not consummated the marriage. In Matthew, Isa allows divorce if it is discovered during the betrothal stage that the wife was not a virgin.

It had three primary meanings in the Tawrat. 1) Sometimes, it meant a human being, as in Numbers 23:19. 2) Many times, it was used to mean a nabi or rasul (93 times in the scroll of Ezekiel alone). 3) The one prophesied in the Tawrah, Daniel 7:14, who was coming to Allah on the clouds of the sky and whom Allah was going to give rule, kingship, and glory over all peoples, nations, and language groups forever in an eternal kingdom. When Isa used this title with the religious authorities, they understood this meaning.

They were responsible for assuring that the animals were acceptable for sacrifice (not blind, lame, sick, etc.) and might have had an agreement with the animal sellers that only animals sold by the sellers would be acceptable. Thus the foreigners who came to worship Allah at the house of Allah might have been cheated in changing money and in paying extra for the sacrificial animals. Isa disapproved of cheating people who were sincerely trying to worship Allah. In addition, people from other ummas could only come into this court, and not the inner courts. All the commerce made the atmosphere not conducive for them to worship Allah.

Thus this translation, being before any changes to the Injil, does not include it. The story is about a woman who was caught committing adultery. She only (and not the man) was brought to Isa by leaders of Al-Yahud, and they asked Isa to condemn her. Isa answered that the person who had no sin could begin the process of killing her, so everyone left. Then Isa told her that he did not condemn her, and to stop sinning.

Allah is the Most Loving, Most Gracious King, and Isa is his amir, or prince, who has his authority. Of course, Allah did not have sexual relations with the mother of Isa (far be it from Allah!), but his relationship with Isa is as the relation of a loving king to his beloved prince: The prince and the king work together, the prince has the authority of the king, the king and the prince are inseparable in purpose and will, the king and the prince have the same nature or character (Isa had a nature from Ruh Allah as well as a human nature from his mother Mariam), and this relationship is unique (no other person was conceived by Holy Ruh Allah.

The word sister can include sister-in-law as well, and early historians say that the husband of this Mariam, Clopas, was a brother of Yusif (the husband of Mariam and the step-father of Isa). It is improbable that parents would name two different sisters the same name. So this Mariam was most probably the sister-in-law of Mariam, mother of Isa.
